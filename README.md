# CSUCI-COMP-559-Algorithms

This repository contains various algorithm implementations for the CSUCI COMP 559 course. Below is a brief description of each file and the algorithms they implement.

## Files

### [HW2.py](HW2.py)
This file contains the implementation of Prim's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph using a custom minimum priority queue.

### [HW3.py](HW3.py)
This file contains the implementation of a dynamic programming algorithm for sequence alignment. It calculates the minimum cost to align two given strings.

### [HW4.py](HW4.py)
This file contains the implementation of a dynamic programming algorithm to determine if a string `z` can be formed by interleaving two other strings `x` and `y`.

### [HW5_rabin_miller.py](HW5_rabin_miller.py)
This file contains the implementation of the Rabin-Miller primality test, a probabilistic algorithm to determine if a number is prime.

### [HW5_shank_algorithm.py](HW5_shank_algorithm.py)
This file contains the implementation of Shank's algorithm (also known as Baby-step Giant-step algorithm) to solve the discrete logarithm problem.

## Usage

Each file can be run independently. For example, to run `HW2.py`, use the following command:

```sh
python HW2.py
